Single page solution for AE9000BM.

Input from Chintamani on 26th April 2024:
```
   We checked the meter WATT/ VAR/ PF (MODBUS) converted from AE9000BM in which following software modifications required to be done:

1.       For POWER WATT/ VAR reading on MODBUS above 1000 MW/ 1000 MVAR false reading are observed like ????. reading up to 900MW/ 900MVAR are only observed on Modbus output.

2.       In set up menu Scroll Time/ Energy Reset & LED test should be removed as it is not required for this particular meter.

Kindly make above corrections.
